<h2>ResNet Registration Help</h2>

You must register a device before it will function on ResNet. When an
unregistered device connects to a jack the network electronics
assign its port to a special network segment which has connectivity only
to the registration server. After a device is registered and it is
restarted, its port will be reassigned to a routed ResNet segment.<br><br>

  You must log in before you can register a machine. Log in with the
  credentials you use to log in to the network in the labs. <p>

  Your session will expire after 15 minutes of inactivity and you will need
  to log in again.

  If you are registering a device from a ResNet jack, the system should
  automatically determine
  your Ethernet address and operating system. If it is necessary to enter
  your Ethernet address manually, you can find it by running winipcfg on
  Win9x systems, running ipconfig /all on WinNT, Win2k and WinXP systems, or by
  accessing the AppleTalk or TCP/IP control panel on Macintosh systems.
  The Ethernet address consists of 12 hex digits and contains no delimiting
  colons or dashes, e.g. <font color="blue">0000e8129245</font>. 
  This address must be correct in the database or your machine will not be able
  to connect to ResNet.<p>

  Click the Agree & submit button to register your device. <b>You will be held
  responsible for any violations of the appropriate use  policy by devices
  registered under your name.</b> There is a limit of three registrations per
  user.<p>

  If there are no errors, the registration system will return a hostname for your device.
  This hostname uniquely identifies your computer. Your IP address will change,
  but normally your hostname will remain the same.<p>

  Several of the ResNet tables are only updated every 15 minutes, so you may
  need to wait for your newly registered device to function on the network.
  After registering, shut down your system and wait until the next quarter
  hour before restarting and attempting to access the network. On Win95
  systems it may be necessary to initiate a DHCP release and renew via
  winipcfg after the reboot.

<a name="edit"><b>Edit</b></a>
<p>
<blockquote>
  This option permits you to edit or delete records of machines you have
  registered. You will need to edit a record if you have replaced your
  Ethernet card. Use the
  Next and Previous buttons to cycle through the hosts registered to you.
  Use the Update button to save changes you make. Use the Delete button to
  delete a device you no longer own. <b>Updates and deletes are written to
  the database immediately.</b>
